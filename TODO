# game stuff
DONE fix worldspawn having an unusual offset - was because of missing worldspawn entity in FGD used by QodotMap
DONE simple WASD+jump movement
DONE simple camera movement
DONE basic build engine WASD movement
DONE basic build engine camera bobbing
DONE clamp camera pitch (+/- 90 degrees)
DONE add simple initial-jump jump-squat, inspired by build engine jumping
DONE add jump landing squat, like build engine jump landing
DONE refactor run, jump, and land bobbing to use Curves
DONE fix double-bobbing when landing while still rising in the jump
DONE "vault" ledges when jumping into them, build engine style
DONE make consecutive bhops more fluid (jumping as you land shouldnt incur another jump squat)
DONE make jump arc more cartoonish, like build engine jump speeds being not physically accurate
TODO edge-jump coyote time
TODO make coyote time toggle-able for testing purposes (we may not actually want coyote time)
TODO wall-edge-landing - if the player is standing perfectly still and jumps when touching a short wall with a ledge, they will land on the ledge
TODO add grapple hook
TODO create simple hitscan weapon behaviour (shoots, reloads, consumes ammo)
TODO add decals when a hitscan weapon hits a solid wall
TODO create ammo pickups that give ammo of specific types to the target
TODO create some shitty developer art for viewmodels
TODO build engine style viewmodel bobbing (it has this though right?)
TODO research generating navigation meshes for qodot maps
TODO create a dumbass sprite NPC that wanders around on the nav mesh
TODO make the dumbass NPC shootable, take damage, and die
TODO give the NPC frames for various perspectives from the player's PoV
TODO give the NPC a shitty death animation
TODO add blood particles gush animation when NPC is shot
TODO add blood splatter decals around NPCs that are shot
TODO figure out if we actually wanna go the 2d-sprite-in-3d-environment aesthetic
TODO make the player take damage & die
DONE add basic seamless portal rendering between two linked portals
DONE fix lighting through seamless portals (may just need to be multiplied?)
DONE fix clipping protection on seamless portals (see protect_screen_clipping)
TODO fix oblique projection on portals
TODO fix object slicing on portals
TODO update portal-traveller velocity & rotation when they go through a portal, such that it is oriented correctly as they come out of the portal
TODO ensure support for emissive textures in default material
TODO default material adds dither to all surfaces
TODO default material supports transparency (flag in TB? or maybe per-texture material)
TODO rewrite env_sprite in C# (? maybe base qodot entities are always written in gdscript, since its only ever ran at build-time)
TODO consider refactoring QodotEntity to support both gdscript and C# implementations (compositional approach?)
TODO simple opaque color shader for surface if current camera (CAMERA_POSITION_WORLD) is not the portal's camera. for recursion
TODO fix lighting around portals (since the portal camera renders the portal without the surface, the shadow isnt there. Maybe these shadows need to be baked.)
TODO finish recursive portals (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWpFZbjtSQg)

# silly ideas
we gotta make a level where if you let go of your grapple too soon you just go flying out into space and die
