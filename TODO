# playtests
TODO create simple environment with many platforms and shapes that the player can run and grapple on

# game stuff
TODO fix console not working in actual game dev scene
DONE fix worldspawn having an unusual offset - was because of missing worldspawn entity in FGD used by QodotMap
DONE simple WASD+jump movement
DONE simple camera movement
DONE basic build engine WASD movement
DONE basic build engine camera bobbing
DONE clamp camera pitch (+/- 90 degrees)
DONE add simple initial-jump jump-squat, inspired by build engine jumping
DONE add jump landing squat, like build engine jump landing
DONE refactor run, jump, and land bobbing to use Curves
DONE fix double-bobbing when landing while still rising in the jump
DONE "vault" ledges when jumping into them, build engine style
DONE make consecutive bhops more fluid (jumping as you land shouldnt incur another jump squat)
DONE make jump arc more cartoonish, like build engine jump speeds being not physically accurate
DONE add grapple hook
DONE clean up interaction between ground movement and grapple hook (maybe move grapple accel code into the movement code)
DONE replace grapple hook with more cartoonish utrakill-like grapple
DONE fix "speed storage"/speed buildup when holding down a movement direction into a wall while grapple hooking (maybe don't accelerate in a particular direction if they're touching a wall in that direction)

TODO fix osclliation with grapple hook when player stuck behind an obstacle (apply friction when player is touching a wall or something?)
TODO grapple hook bhopping? this may not be realistic with the ultrakill-like grapple hook anymore
DONE add jump out of grapple hook, transposing some of the grapple momentum upwards, towards the direction the player is inputting
TODO reconsider jump out of grapple hook (maybe grapple hook can be just a simple pull)

TODO add decals when a hitscan weapon hits a solid wall
TODO create ammo pickups that give ammo of specific types to the target
TODO create some shitty developer art for 2d viewmodels
TODO build engine style 2d viewmodel bobbing (it has this though right?)
TODO normal, diffuse, metallic mapping on 2d viewmodel
TODO research generating navigation meshes for qodot maps

TODO add blood splatter decals around NPCs that are shot
TODO figure out if we actually wanna go the 2d-sprite-in-3d-environment aesthetic
TODO make the player take damage & die
TODO grapple hook viewmodel animation
TODO UI for grapple hook status/cooldown
TODO edge-jump coyote time
TODO make coyote time toggle-able for testing purposes (we may not actually want coyote time)

DONE add basic seamless portal rendering between two linked portals
DONE fix lighting through seamless portals (may just need to be multiplied?)
DONE fix clipping protection on seamless portals (see protect_screen_clipping)
TODO fix oblique projection on portals
TODO fix object slicing on portals
TODO update portal-traveller velocity & rotation when they go through a portal, such that it is oriented correctly as they come out of the portal
TODO ensure support for emissive textures in default material
TODO default material adds dither to all surfaces
TODO default material supports transparency (flag in TB? or maybe per-texture material)
TODO rewrite env_sprite in C# (? maybe base qodot entities are always written in gdscript, since its only ever ran at build-time)
TODO consider refactoring QodotEntity to support both gdscript and C# implementations (compositional approach?)
TODO simple opaque color shader for surface if current camera (CAMERA_POSITION_WORLD) is not the portal's camera. for recursion
TODO fix lighting around portals (since the portal camera renders the portal without the surface, the shadow isnt there. Maybe these shadows need to be baked.)
TODO finish recursive portals (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWpFZbjtSQg)

# polish
TODO dry fire sfx/animation grapple hook during cooldown

# silly ideas
we gotta make a level where if you let go of your grapple too soon you just go flying out into space and die
