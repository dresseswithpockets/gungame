Note: Very high spot_attenuation values (typically above 10) can impact performance negatively if the light is made to use a larger spot_range to compensate. This is because culling opportunities will become less common and shading costs will be increased (as the light will cover more pixels on screen while resulting in the same amount of brightness). To improve performance, use the lowest spot_attenuation value possible for the visuals you're trying to achieve.",
